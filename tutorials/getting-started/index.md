# Getting started tutorial

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- Use the create-chiselstrike-app command to create a scaffold ChiselStrike
  project.
- Use the ChiselStrike CLI to develop locally.
- Define an entity with TypeScript.
- Use the ChiselStrike REST API to perform basic CRUD operations on the entity.
- Deploy the API to the ChiselStrike managed cloud service.

We recommend following this tutorial on MacOS or Linux. It will also work on
Windows under WSL.

## Requirements

You will need the following developer tools installed:

- A code editor of your choice, preferably one that supports TypeScript.
- node installed in your shell PATH, version 14.18.0 or later.
- curl installed in your shell PATH. You may use other tools to fetch a URL, but
  example commands will be shown using curl.

You should have a general understanding of how nodejs projects work. Knowledge
of TypeScript is not necessary, but helpful.
