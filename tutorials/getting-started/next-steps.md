# Next steps

Congratuations! You've finished the first ChiselStrike tutorial. You should now
be able to build your own fully functional CRUD API locally using TypeScript and
the ChiselStrike CLI, then deploy it to ChiselStrike's managed cloud.

You can continue to engage with ChiselStrike using these resources:

- The [reference documentation][1] will help you learn about more of its
  features and APIs.
- The [examples][2] illustrate how integrate with ChiselStrike.
- ChiselStrike communities let you interact with staff and other developers.

Happy chiseling!
