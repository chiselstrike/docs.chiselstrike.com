# Welcome to ChiselStrike!

ChiselStrike is a code-driven solution that enables you to quickly build your
applicationâ€™s backend. It integrates easily with [Gatsby][gatsby],
[Next.js][nextjs], or any of your preferred Jamstack frameworks. You can also
use it standalone to build a backend for any application.

## Features

- Automatic generation of a fully-functional CRUD API. You just define the
  entity model with TypeScript classes. The API can be customized to meet
  specific needs.
- Create your own API endpoints with custom code.
- End user authentication supported with [NextAuth.js][nextauth].
- Data policy definitions with field- and user-level granularity.

:::note

The ChiselStrike managed backend service is currently in beta.
